### Cryptography?
The methodology of concealing the content of messages. Originates from the Greek root word _kryptos_, which means _hidden_. The modern scientific study of crytography is sometimes referred to as _cryptology_[^1].

### Shift Cipher
Otherwise known as a caesar cipher, the **shift cipher** takes each letter in a plaintext message and shifts it by `n` indexes in the looping alphabet.
